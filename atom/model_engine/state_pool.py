class StateTransfer:
    """How a backend hands one request's state over to another group.

    Three answers, and every checkpoint decision downstream follows from which:

      `none()`    no per-request state, or none that can be handed over at all.
                  Nothing is ever checkpointed and prefix hits shrink to 0.
      `fork(n)`   the state rolls. The owner gives its group to the index and
                  takes a fresh one, reading the old and writing the new for
                  exactly one forward — which has to leave the new group
                  self-contained, and that takes `n` committed tokens.
      `copy()`    one request's state is a contiguous byte range another group
                  can be handed a duplicate of. Nothing is given away, so
                  nothing downstream has to cooperate: no successor forward, and
                  the resuming side is handed a duplicate too.

    The two mechanisms are not interchangeable, and which one a backend can
    offer decides where it may checkpoint. A fork's contract binds the *next*
    forward, so it can only be taken where that forward is known to be long
    enough — true on a prompt, false during generation, where a step commits
    `1 + accepted_drafts` and acceptance is not knowable in advance. That is why
    DeepSeek-V4 copies: it is the only way to checkpoint at a decode boundary.
    See `/app/logs_claude/verify_v4_min_fork.py` for the arithmetic.

    These used to be one integer, `min_fork_tokens`, with 0 spelling `none()` —
    which is exactly the value `copy()` has to report, so the two were
    indistinguishable. Splitting the kind out is what lets a backend say "no
    successor needed" without saying "no state".

class StateGroupPool:
    """Per-request state groups, plus a content index over the free ones.

    A *group* is what one request occupies in the pre-allocated state tensor:
    `entries // entries_per_req` contiguous indices (GDN conv+ssm, the
    DeepSeek-V4 compressor ring and sliding window). This pool owns the free
    list, so it is the single answer to "can one more request be admitted".

    A per-request state cannot be rebuilt from cached KV blocks: the cache holds
    the compressor's *output*, the state is its rolling *input* window. So a
    prefix-cache hit is only recoverable up to a boundary where somebody
    checkpointed the state — which is what the index over the free list
    answers.

    Capacity model: a checkpoint is a group sitting on the free list with its
    content still valid, filed under the content hash of the last block it
    covers. This is the KV block pool's lazy-eviction model (`pop` drops the
    hash at hand-out time, not at free time) applied to state groups. The index
    therefore holds nothing back — `pop` invalidates whatever it hands out, so a
    checkpoint can never shrink admission, and under full concurrency the
    checkpoint set drains to empty on its own.

    *How* a group reaches the index is the backend's `StateTransfer`, and it is
    the only thing that differs between the two mechanisms this class runs:

      `fork`  the owner gives its group away and takes a fresh one, so the
              checkpoint costs no bytes but binds the very next forward, which
              has to leave the replacement self-contained (`min_fork_tokens`).
      `copy`  the state is a byte range, so a duplicate goes to the index and
              the owner is not disturbed at all. Nothing is bound: no successor
              forward, and the resuming side copies rather than forking too.

    Both meet the same index and the same free list. Under `copy` the bytes are
    moved by a forward, so this class only schedules the pairs (`take_copies`)
    and the next batch issues them.

    The count of groups is not fixed for life: `extend` and `retire_top` move it
    when the state pool's share of the byte budget changes. Retiring is
    index-forced but its cost is not — see `retire_top`.

    Vocabulary: *checkpoint* is the state sense throughout — a boundary this
    class kept resumable. *Publish* is reserved for a block entering the
    content-addressed KV index (`BlockManager.hash_blocks`, the KV events).

    `enabled` covers the *index* only. The free list stays live either way:
    admission needs a group whether or not anything is ever checkpointed.

        Two mechanisms, chosen by the backend's `StateTransfer`:

        `fork` — the group cannot be shared while its owner still writes it, so
        the owner moves to a fresh group and the old one, never written again,
        becomes the checkpoint. The next forward reads it and fills the
        replacement, which is the whole reason `min_fork_tokens` gates the
        position.

        `copy` — the owner keeps writing where it is and a duplicate of its
        state goes to the index instead. Only the intent is recorded here; the
        destination group and the copy pair come from `take_copies` when the next
        batch is built. Deferred because the bytes have to be moved by a forward, and
        a checkpoint indexed before its bytes exist would hand a resuming
        request whatever the destination happened to hold.

        `boundary_blocks` is unused here: a group is a single entry, not a span
        of them. It is in the protocol for classes whose checkpoint is a run of
        entries ending at the boundary.

        Best-effort under both: with no free group the seq simply keeps writing
        its own and no checkpoint is taken.
