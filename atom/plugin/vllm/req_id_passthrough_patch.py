"""Expose the current step's request ids (CPU, batch-ordered) to ATOM builders.

The DeepSeek-V4 proxy metadata build needs a stable per-request key to assign a
state slot (its SWA ring + compressor state). Previously it derived that key
from ``block_table_tensor[:, 0]`` with a ``.cpu()`` copy, which forces a host<->
device sync and leaves a large bubble on the decode stream even though the copy
itself is tiny.

vLLM already has the canonical, host-resident key: ``input_batch.req_ids``. By
the time attention metadata is built it has been reordered together with the
block table / seq_lens rows (``InputBatch.swap_states``), so ``req_ids[i]``
lines up with row ``i`` of every per-request tensor.

This patch wraps two GPUModelRunner methods to snapshot ``req_ids`` into a
thread-local for the duration of each call:

* ``_build_attention_metadata`` -- constructs ``CommonAttentionMetadata`` *and*
  drives the target ``builder.build()`` in one synchronous call.
* ``propose_draft_token_ids`` -- drives the MTP/Eagle drafter, which (in current
  vLLM) builds its *own* attention metadata via
  ``SpecDecodeBaseProposer.build_per_group_and_layer_attn_metadata`` ->
  ``build_for_drafting`` -> the ATOM V4 bridge, entirely outside
  ``_build_attention_metadata``. Without this second wrap the thread-local is
  unset during drafting and the V4 slot allocator's fail-fast contract trips.

The drafter reuses the target step's ``input_batch`` ordering (pure decodes were
already pulled to the front and the batch is not re-reordered before the draft
forward), so ``req_ids[i]`` still aligns with row ``i`` of the draft metadata --
the same invariant the target build relies on. ATOM's V4 metadata builder reads
the snapshot via ``get_current_req_ids()`` and keys slot allocation on it, with
no D2H. All of this lives in ATOM; no vLLM source is modified.
