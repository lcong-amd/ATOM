"""Expert slot layout for FusedMoE parameters.

Where each expert's weights live inside the fused ``w13_weight`` / ``w2_weight``
buffers, and which of those slots a given rank owns.  Both the weight loader
and the batched staging path need this, and they must agree byte for byte, so
it lives in one place instead of being re-derived at each call site.

Deliberately pure ``torch`` — no AITER, no ``atom.config`` — so the model
loader's unit tests can exercise the real layout on a plain CPU runner.
