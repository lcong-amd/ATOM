"""State-write Triton kernels for V4 attention backend.

Replaces the per-seq Python state writes in `deepseek_v4.py` (PR-A Phase 1).
Inputs are flat batched tensors; per-token slot/position lookups happen
inside the kernel — no `.item()` syncs.

Currently implemented:
- `swa_write`: writes the LAST `min(tok_n_b, write_per_batch)` tokens of
  every seq `b ∈ [0, bs)` into `swa_kv[state_slot_per_seq[b],
  positions[src] % cache_size, :] = kv[src, :]`. `src_id` is derived inside
  the kernel from `cu_seqlens_q + row_in_batch` — no shared per-token
  `write_indices` GPU buffer (which had a DMA-tear race when the next fwd's
  CPU rewrite landed mid-H2D). `cache_size = window_size + max_spec_steps`
  — for non-MTP this reduces to `window_size`; for MTP-k draft tokens get
  their own ring slots separate from the verified token's slot.
- `update_compressor_states`: unified in-place update of Compressor's
  per-request `kv_state` + `score_state` ring buffers, covering both prefill
  (B-side overlap context + tail) and decode (every token at `pos % STATE_SIZE`
  in a single ring). Layout follows paper §3.6.1 (per-request fixed-size state
  cache) but indexes the buffer as ONE ring of size `STATE_SIZE = 2*ratio`
  (CSA overlap) or `ratio` (HCA). Token at absolute `pos` always lands at
  `kv_state[slot, pos % STATE_SIZE]` — no segment switching, no roll. The
  Compressor's softmax-pool consumer reads two halves whose A-side / B-side
  identity alternates by block-id parity; see `Compressor.forward` for that
  consumer-side logic.

Caller contract (`swa_write`):
- `kv`                  [T, head_dim] flat — full per-fwd KV (forward_vars).
- `positions`           [T] int — full positions buffer (forward_vars).
- `cu_seqlens_q`        [bs+1] int — per-fwd cumulative seqlens (so
                        seq `i` covers token rows `[cu_seqlens_q[i], cu_seqlens_q[i+1])`
                        in `kv` / `positions`). Per-seq token count is
                        derived inside the kernel as `cu_seqlens_q[i+1] -
                        cu_seqlens_q[i]`.
- `state_slot_per_seq`  [bs] int — `state_slot_mapping_gpu_i32`.
- `swa_kv`              [num_slots, cache_size, head_dim] in-place buffer.
- `cache_size`          int ring-slot count = `window_size + max_spec_steps`
                        (e.g. 128 + 0 = 128 non-MTP; 128 + 1 = 129 MTP-1).
- `write_per_batch`     int — max tokens to write per seq this fwd
                        (= `min(max_q_len, cache_size)`). Used as Triton
                        `constexpr` for grid sizing.

Grid = `(bs, write_per_batch)`; each program writes one (seq, row-in-seq)
token. Per-seq actual count is `min(token_num_per_seq[bs], write_per_batch)`;
threads whose `row_in_batch >= actual_count` bail. The kernel derives
`src_id = cu_seqlens_q[i+1] - actual_count + row_in_batch` — selects the
LAST `actual_count` tokens of seq `i` in `kv` / `positions`, no shared
GPU index buffer needed (no DMA race window).

# === Unified Compressor state save (plan path) ==========================

# tokens + previous block as overlap context (B-side, eq 11)". ATOM keeps
# this as a single ring of size `STATE_SIZE = 2*ratio` (CSA overlap) or
# `ratio` (HCA). Each token at absolute `pos` writes to slot
# `pos % STATE_SIZE`; the consumer (`fused_compress.*` kernel) reads its K
# source rows per-source-position, dispatching INPUT vs state cache by the
# `k_static >= window_len` plan field (where `window_len` is the count of
# leading K-loop iterations that go to state cache, encoded per-boundary in
# `compress_plan`).
#
# Write window selection (HOST side, in compress_plan.make_compress_plans):
#   write_plan rows = tokens whose absolute `pos >= max(0, seq_len - STATE_SIZE)`.

# === DSpark paged window gather (read side of paged-SWA migration) =======
# DSpark's block drafter attends `[rolling target window ++ draft block]`. The
# window KV now lives in the shared paged pool (`unified_kv`, draft layer slice
# bound as `attn.swa_kv`), content-addressed by `swa_block_tables` exactly like
# the V4 target SWA. The block-sparse attention still wants a DENSE `[B, W, D]`
# window tensor (it concatenates the in-forward draft KV and runs `sparse_attn`),
# so this kernel materialises that window from the pool.
#
# Window slot `s ∈ [0, W)` for seq `b` holds the target token at absolute
# position `p = anchor_pos[b] - (W - 1) + s`. Slots with `p < 0` are unfilled
# (the caller's `valid_target` mask drops them; we zero them here so a stray read
# is harmless). Filled slots map to the pool via the same addressing as the
# paged write:
#     blk     = p // block_size
#     phys    = swa_block_tables[b, blk]
#     src_row = phys * block_size + (p % block_size)
