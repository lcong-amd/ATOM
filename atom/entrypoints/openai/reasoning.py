"""Reasoning/thinking content separation for thinking models.

A dialect-agnostic engine: it separates the reasoning channel from the final
answer, both for a complete response (``separate_reasoning``) and for a token
stream (``ReasoningFilter``), emitting the standard ``reasoning_content`` field.
All model-specific marker knowledge lives in ``reasoning_dialects.DIALECTS``;
this module contains no per-model conditions. Add a model there, not here.
