"""Reasoning-channel dialects (model-specific data for the general engine).

The engine in ``reasoning.py`` is dialect-agnostic: it iterates ``DIALECTS`` to
detect/split the reasoning channel. All model-specific marker knowledge lives
here. Adding a model = add one ``ReasoningDialect`` entry (and its ``split`` for
whole-response separation).

Two dialects today, named by format rather than model:
  - inline ``<think>...</think>`` (DeepSeek-R1, Qwen3, Kimi-K2, MiniMax, ...).
    The opening tag may be emitted in the output or injected by the template.
  - structured channel format: one stream split into named channels (think /
    response / tools), each wrapped in framing tokens. The same concept as
    OpenAI Harmony's analysis/final/commentary channels (gpt-oss). The opening
    tag is template-injected, so the output begins *inside* the reasoning
    channel. Different channel-format models use different framing tokens; the
    entry below carries Kimi-K3's (``<|open|>think<|sep|>`` ...), and another
    such model would add its own entry with its own tokens.
