"""The engine: one reader of a model's output, for both delivery modes.

A format (:class:`~.tool_parser.ToolCallParser`) says what its own bytes mean.
Everything a reader has to decide that is *not* particular to a format is
decided here, once: how far ahead of a region it is safe to release, which
markers are framing and get dropped, what a region that parses to no call
means, which index a call is stamped with, and what happens to the answer that
follows the markup.

`stream=false` is :func:`read_whole`, which is this engine over a single chunk.
That is the whole of why the two delivery modes agree -- not a test that
compares them, but no second implementation to compare against.

# immediately reopen a region with a fresh budget: 1.19 ms -> 18.2 s on a
# 250 KB answer, in the request coroutine, stalling the event loop for
# everything else.

    Only when the region owes one. Walking unconditionally could not tell the
    wrapper from an answer that *ends by naming* it: of 53 shapes whose
    trailing literal was the model's own text it kept 26, against 47 here.
    Deleting the walk instead keeps all 47 and leaves the wrapper in `content`

    Takes the whole trailing run once entered, so two quoted closers against
    one owed wrapper lose both. Spending the count as a budget fixes that and
    needs the unmerged spans plus a per-span balance; measured identical on
    all 5220 cross-format corpus pairs, so it waits for a real output.

    An offset, not a span. Splicing the wrapper in as one made it compete for
    a call: two adjacent calls merge into a single span, so the wrapper span
    became the last, took the leftover call, and emitted the prose before it
    -- the same output ordered differently depending on whether the closing
    tag had arrived.

    Never before the markup it follows, or a region that is nothing but a call
    walks back over the call's own closer, in front of the caller's cursor.

    Trailing edge only. A wrapper opener followed by prose is byte-identical
    to an answer quoting the opener before calling for real, and

    a leading scan here deleted exactly such a quotation. So an opening

        far and with ``at_end=False``. That is what makes it agree with the
        call that eventually goes out: same function, same enumeration, the
        second run seeing a superset of the first's bytes. Every format used
        to answer this with a regex of its own, and four of the five had it
        disagree with their parse -- most recently over a self-closing
        ``<invoke name="x"/>`` the peek skipped and the parse returned first,
        which put three tool calls on the wire for a response containing two.

        Only for a name the request actually declared. That check is what
        makes an early name safe to send: it cannot be taken back, and an
        answer merely quoting `<tool_call><function=NAME>` opens a region too.
        A name the client never offered is overwhelmingly likelier to be prose
        than a call, so it waits for the region to close like everything else.
        SGLang's cursor parsers announce with no such check and will emit a
        call named after whatever follows the tag.

        Asked of `Region.head` -- the first `_PEEK_WINDOW` bytes and no more
        -- and asked at most once more after it fills. Running a format's
        regex over the whole region on every chunk is quadratic in the
        response and measured 3.0 -> 9.8 -> 36 -> 137 ms across 2k/4k/8k/16k
