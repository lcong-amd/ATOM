"""GLM-4.5 / 4.6 / 5.x tool-call format::

    <tool_call>NAME
    <arg_key>K1</arg_key><arg_value>V1</arg_value>
    <arg_key>K2</arg_key><arg_value>V2</arg_value>
    ...</tool_call>

The function name follows the opening tag directly (no ``<function=`` wrapper,
which is how this is told apart from the Qwen3 XML format). GLM's chat template
renders non-string argument values with ``tojson`` and string values raw, so a
value is JSON-decoded when the request schema declares a non-string type (or
when it parses as JSON) and otherwise kept as a raw string.
