"""MiniMax-M3 tool-call format.

Every tag is prefixed by the ns_token ``]<]minimax[>[``::

    ]<]minimax[>[<tool_call>
    ]<]minimax[>[<invoke name="NAME">
    ]<]minimax[>[<pname>value]<]minimax[>[</pname>
    ...
    ]<]minimax[>[</invoke>
    ]<]minimax[>[</tool_call>

Unlike DSML, parameters are named by the TAG itself (``<city>Paris</city>``),
not a ``name="..."`` attribute. Values: schema type wins, else JSON, else raw
string.

The ns_token is *not* stripped first, though this said so long after the code
stopped doing it: parsing a copy with it deleted made every offset meaningless
against the bytes that arrived.
