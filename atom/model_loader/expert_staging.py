"""Batched staging for MoE expert weights.

On a large MoE checkpoint each expert's weights arrive as their own tensor, so
the per-expert `weight_loader` issues one small host-to-device copy per
(expert, shard) — tens of thousands of them, latency-bound rather than
bandwidth-bound. The pool coalesces every arrival for one fused parameter into
a CPU staging buffer and writes the result back with a single large copy.

Ownership rule: the pool writes back only the (expert slot, shard) regions it
actually staged. Any other loader path may write the same parameter as long as
it touches different regions, which is what lets a checkpoint that stores
routed experts one way and shared experts another -- Qwen3.5 BF16 stacks the
routed experts into a single tensor -- load correctly. Before writing such a
parameter, that other path calls `decline` so the two never race for a region.

Deliberately free of AITER and of `atom.config`: the pool talks to a MoE module
only through the protocol below, so it can be unit-tested on a plain CPU
runner.
