"""Garbage-collector policy for the serving processes.

CPython's gen-2 pass is stop-the-world and traverses every tracked container,
so its cost tracks the live heap -- which here is almost all startup state
(model, compiled graph, tokenizer, KV block pool) that is never garbage.
Measured on DeepSeek-V4-Flash-DSpark tp1: 268 ms in the EngineCore, 979 ms in a
ModelRunner worker, 265 ms in the API server, each reclaiming 0 objects.

That is the argument for freezing rather than tuning thresholds: the collector
is not merely slow here, it finds nothing. Everything the hot loop allocates is
acyclic, so reference counting takes it.

    it finds it, so current garbage would be made permanently unreclaimable.
    One full pass suffices -- `gc.collect()` covers all three generations, and
    freezing does not care which one an object ended up in.

    Objects created afterwards are still tracked and collected, so this is not
    `gc.disable()` -- a cycle written by later code is still caught. What it
    forfeits is anything alive *now* that later becomes garbage, which in these
