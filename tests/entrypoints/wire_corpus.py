"""One call per wire format, asked of the formats themselves.

Nothing here is written by hand: `REAL_CALLS` is built by asking every
registered parser to `render_call`, and every shape the suites need is derived
from it. A format registered tomorrow is covered by every property the moment
it exists, with nothing added here.

Hand-written samples were the alternative and one of them was wrong in the way
that matters: MiniMax's was written in DSML's spelling and parsed to
`get_weather({})`, exercising none of the parameter path.

Generating does not by itself fix that -- a renderer and a parser written from
the same misunderstanding round-trip perfectly. :func:`check_corpus`'s last
check does: a format's call must be *identified* by its own parser and no
other.
