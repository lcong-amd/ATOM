"""Deciding a model's tool-call format before it emits anything.

The format used to be sniffed from the output, which meant deciding from a
prefix: a discriminator might not have arrived yet, so the answer needed a
"cannot tell" state, and a wrong guess was silent. A chat template rendered
with a tools payload is the model's own instructions for calling one, and it
exists before the first token.

The rule under test is deliberately not a new table: it is the shipped
`_DETECT_ORDER` cascade, asked of the prompt instead of the output.
