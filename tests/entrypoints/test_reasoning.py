class TestNonReasoningOutputIsNotWithheld:
    """A stream that never opens a reasoning channel must still reach the client.

    The shapes are PR #1961's, kept verbatim. They came off an observed
    production stall -- 1.5-2.4% of requests on a Claude-Code agent corpus
    returned HTTP 200 and then zero body bytes until the client's 600s read
    timeout, while the engine decoded to `max_tokens` -- and an observed shape
    is worth more than one invented to fit the rule.

    The rule itself is `TestBoundedWithhold` in
    `test_stream_marker_properties.py`, which asks it of every registered
    dialect crossed with every format, against a control with the trigger
    characters neutralised. These are the point cases beside that axis, and
    they pass here for a structural reason rather than a patched one: the
    buffer-and-threshold state machine #1961 fixes (`len(self.buf) > 100 and
    "<" not in self.buf`, which withheld everything for as long as the answer
    contained a `<` anywhere -- and code is full of them) no longer exists.
    `MarkerScanner` releases whatever cannot begin a declared marker, so there
    is no threshold to tune and nowhere for the defect to live.

    Measured against a scanner mutated to withhold anything containing a `<`:
    the first two catch it, the last three are feature guards and correctly do
    not, and `test_token_by_token_code_output_streams` does not either -- it
    asserts only that *something* was emitted, and under partial withholding
    something still is. Said out loud because a test that cannot fail reads
    like one that can. `TestBoundedWithhold` is where the discrimination
    lives: it compares the first content byte's offset against the same text
    with its trigger characters neutralised.
