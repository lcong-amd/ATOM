"""`gc.freeze()` is what removes the collector's cost; these pin what it costs.

Freezing is the only knob here that changes what the collector *may not touch*,
so the two things worth a test are the two ways it can be wrong: freezing too
much (garbage made permanent, or never handed back) and freezing too little
(the safety net gone, which would make it `gc.disable()` in disguise).

Each case carries the failure shape it guards, because a happy-path assertion
would pass against a `freeze_gc_heap` that did nothing at all.
