# Tests for per-request state checkpoints: the third prefix-cache gate.
#
# Neither the GDN recurrent state nor the V4 compressor ring can be rebuilt
# from cached KV blocks, so a prefix hit is only resumable at a boundary where
# some earlier request published its state. `StateGroupPool` indexes those
# boundaries and `BlockManager` shrinks the hit to the rightmost one — without
# it, a hit hands the resumed forward a group straight off the free list and it
# reads the previous occupant's state.
#
# Capacity model under test: a checkpoint is a FREE group whose content is
# still valid (the KV block pool's lazy eviction, applied to state groups). So
# checkpoints must never reduce the number of admissible requests, and the
# eviction event is hand-out, not free.
