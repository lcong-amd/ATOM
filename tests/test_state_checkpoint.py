# Tests for per-request state checkpoints: the third prefix-cache gate.
#
# Neither the GDN recurrent state nor the V4 compressor ring can be rebuilt
# from cached KV blocks, so a prefix hit is only resumable at a boundary where
# some earlier request published its state. `StateGroupPool` indexes those
# boundaries and `BlockManager` shrinks the hit to the rightmost one — without
# it, a hit hands the resumed forward a group straight off the free list and it
# reads the previous occupant's state.
#
# Fork-transfer checkpoints are FREE groups whose content is still valid.
# Copy-transfer checkpoints are immutable PAGE-unit images; Active Slots are
# reserved only for resident requests and never serve as checkpoint backing.
